        <h1>GAME MASTER'S SOLUTION KEY</h1>

        <h2 class="culprits">THE CULPRITS:</h2>
        <p>Daniel Brooks and Dr. Lillian Carter</p>

        <h2>THE TRUE MOTIVE:</h2>
        <p>
            Eleanor discovered that Daniel's publishing company was laundering money for illegal pharmaceutical trials conducted by Dr. Carter.
            Her manuscript wasn’t fiction—it was a documented exposé of their crimes, including evidence linking them to the death of her research assistant, who had initially uncovered the connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            The key information came from a <span class="highlight">whistleblower</span> — a former employee at MP Clinical Research — who discovered the illegal drug trials.
            When the whistleblower tried to expose the operation, Dr. Carter and Daniel silenced him by forcing him to become a <span class="highlight">test subject</span> in one of the trials.
            He died from complications during the experiments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before his death, the whistleblower leaked the details to <span class="highlight">Vera Sinclair</span>, not Eleanor. Vera tried to encode the information in her latest book,
            but after being threatened, she never published it. Eleanor pieced together the story from Vera’s unpublished notes and the financial records.
        </p>

        <h2>THE MURDER METHOD:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Dr. Carter prescribed <strong>diazepam</strong> to Eleanor, knowing she would take it that evening.</li>
            <li>Daniel added <strong>amobarbital</strong> to Eleanor's whiskey bottle during a meeting 3 days earlier.</li>
            <li>The combination of diazepam and amobarbital created a sedative overdose, making the death appear accidental.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>THE LOCKED ROOM TRICK:</h2>
        <p>
            Daniel waited outside the study window until Eleanor lost consciousness. He entered through the window using a thin wire through the keyhole to unlock the door from the outside.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>After staging the room to resemble a suicide, Daniel exited the same way and locked the door from the outside using the wire.</li>
            <li>The voicemail Eleanor left about her discovery was deleted remotely by Dr. Carter shortly after Eleanor’s death.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>KEY EVIDENCE:</h2>
        <div class="key-evidence">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Manuscript</strong> — Contained real details about the drug trials and money laundering.</li>
                <li><strong>Toxicology Report</strong> — Showed two sedatives that could only have been combined with both medical knowledge (Dr. Carter) and physical access (Daniel).</li>
                <li><strong>Timeline Discrepancies</strong> — Both Daniel and Dr. Carter were unaccounted for during critical windows.</li>
                <li><strong>Fingerprint Evidence</strong> — Daniel's fingerprints were found on manuscript pages dated after he claimed to have last seen Eleanor.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Records</strong> — Showed Midnight Press paid large sums to MP Clinical Research for unspecified trials.</li>
                <li><strong>Bookmark Note</strong> — Referenced the experimental drug compound and financial coordinates—likely the whistleblower’s hidden message.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>RED HERRINGS EXPLAINED:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="red-herring">❌ <strong>Robert's fingerprints</strong> — He visited Eleanor earlier in the day but was not present during the murder.</li>
            <li class="red-herring">❌ <strong>Katherine’s suspicious behavior</strong> — She was attempting to reconcile with Eleanor and was left out of Eleanor’s original will, which explains her secrecy.</li>
            <li class="red-herring">❌ <strong>Vera’s train trip</strong> — Vera’s departure aligned with the time of the murder, but her location during the critical window clears her of direct involvement.</li>
            <li class="red-herring">❌ <strong>Henry’s matchstick</strong> — Henry was meeting with Katherine privately and had no connection to the murder.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>THE WHISTLEBLOWER:</h2>
        <p>
            - The whistleblower was a lab assistant at MP Clinical Research.<br>
            - He discovered that the trials involved illegal drug combinations with dangerous side effects and multiple patient deaths.<br>
            - After leaking the information to Vera, he was forcibly enrolled in the trial as punishment and died from complications.<br>
            - Vera’s unpublished book contained clues about the trials and the connection to Daniel and Dr. Carter—but she was threatened into silence.
        </p>

        <h2 class="resolution">FINAL RESOLUTION:</h2>
        <p>
            Dr. Carter and Daniel Brooks conspired to kill Eleanor to cover up the illegal drug trials.
            The combination of sedatives ensured Eleanor’s death would appear natural, but the manuscript, financial records, and whistleblower testimony unraveled the truth.
            Vera’s notes and the hidden details in the manuscript ultimately exposed the entire operation.
